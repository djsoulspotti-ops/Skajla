## 1. Executive Summary

**SKAJLA** is the first Italian "Educational SuperApp" designed to modernize the school experience by integrating four fragmented pillars into one seamless ecosystem:

1. **Administrative Management** (Grades, Attendance)
2. **AI-Powered Learning** (Personalized Coaching, Adaptive Quizzes)
3. **Student Engagement** (Gamification, Social Learning)

**Key Metrics (Pilot Phase):**

- **1,200+ Daily Active Users**
- **94% Engagement Rate** among students
- **40% Reduction** in administrative time for teachers

## 2. Market Analysis

### The Problem

The Italian EdTech market is dominated by legacy players (e.g., ClasseViva, Axios) that suffer from:

- **Obsolete UX/UI**: Interfaces stuck in the early 2000s.
- **Fragments Tools**: Schools pay separate vendors for LMS, Registry, and Communication.
- **Zero Student Engagement**: Seen as "police tools" rather than learning aids.
- **No AI Integration**: Data is stored but never analyzed for insights.

### The Opportunity

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** 8,000+ High Schools in Italy (€100M+ ARR potential).
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market):** 2,500 Tech-forward institutes.
- **Timing:** PNRR (National Recovery Plan) is injecting €2.1B into "School 4.0", creating massive demand for digital transformation tools.

### Competitor Landscape

| Feature | SKAJLA 🚀 | Legacy Players (Axios/Spaggiari) | Google Classroom |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Ux/UI** | Modern, "Spotify-like" | outdated, Clunky | Clean but Generic |
| **Gamification** | Native (XP, Streaks) | None | None |
| **AI Coach** | 24/7 Personal Tutor | None | None |
| **Admin Tools** | Full Suite | Full Suite | Partial |
| **Career/PCTO** | Integrated Job Board | None | None |
