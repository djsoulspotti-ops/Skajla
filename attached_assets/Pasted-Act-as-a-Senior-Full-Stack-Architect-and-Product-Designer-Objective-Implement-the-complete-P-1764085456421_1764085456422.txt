Act as a Senior Full-Stack Architect and Product Designer.

**Objective:**
Implement the complete "Parent Dashboard" module (Frontend & Backend).
The goal is to provide parents with real-time monitoring of their child (Grades, Attendance, Behavior).

**Core "Pairing" Logic (Crucial):**
The onboarding must be extremely simple ("Zero Friction").
The Parent connects to the Student account using the **exact same Student Identification Code** (or unique "Matricola") that the student already possesses.
* **Logic:** If Parent inputs Code "X", system finds Student with Code "X" -> Link is established immediately.

Please execute this implementation plan:

**Phase 1: Zero-Friction Pairing Backend**
* **Database Check:** Verify if the `Users` (Student) table already has a unique `identification_code` column. If not, create one.
* **The Linking API:** Create an endpoint `/api/link-parent` that takes the `parent_id` and the `target_student_code`.
* **Validation:** The system must verify the code exists. If valid, create a link in the database (e.g., `ParentStudentMap` table).
* **Security Note:** Ensure that once linked, the parent has read-only access to that specific student's data.

**Phase 2: The Dashboard UI (Frontend)**
* **Onboarding Screen:** When a user creates a Parent account, the first screen should ask: *"Enter your Child's Student ID Code to connect."*
* **Multi-Child Support:** Allow the parent to click "Add another child" and enter a second code to aggregate multiple children in one dashboard.
* **Main View (Mission Control):**
    * **Child Switcher:** Simple tabs/avatars to switch between children.
    * **Stats:** Show Grades, Absences, and Teacher Notes for the selected child.

**Phase 3: Role Guard & Navigation**
* Create the specific route `/parent/dashboard`.
* Ensure the navigation bar changes based on the role (Parent sees "My Children", Student sees "My Grades").

**Start by confirming you understand the "Shared Code" linking logic before generating the code.**
