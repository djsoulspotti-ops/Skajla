⚡️ Prompt (English version — expert-engineered)

PROMPT:

I want you to modify the “messaging” section of my web app by adding a dynamic icon system that visually represents users currently online in real time.

Technical and creative requirements:
	•	Each connected user should be represented by an animated icon or circular avatar (use SVG, Canvas elements, or divs with CSS animations).
	•	The icons must continuously move across the screen, with smooth, natural motion — like floating particles or orbiting nodes.
	•	The system should automatically update in real time when a user connects or disconnects (you can simulate user data if needed).
	•	The visual design should be futuristic and immersive — think neon lights (electric blue, cyan, violet), glow effects, and transparent overlays.
	•	Maintain high performance even with many users (optimize animations using CSS transitions or requestAnimationFrame).
	•	Provide clean, modular, and well-commented HTML/CSS/JS code ready to integrate into an existing frontend (vanilla or React-based).

Aesthetic goal: The interface should evoke a cyberpunk / AI network vibe — as if each user is a living digital particle within a connected system.

Final note: Write efficient, readable, and maintainable code. Ensure the animations loop naturally and feel alive without overwhelming the UI.

(Optional) If possible, use a lightweight animation library like GSAP or anime.js for smoother transitions and physics-like motion.

🚀 Optional enhancement (add this if you want a stronger result):

Include 3D depth or a parallax effect, so icons appear to float in a digital space, giving the scene a metaverse-like feel.
