Create a well-structured application following software engineering best practices.

**Architecture Requirements:**

1. **MVC Design Pattern (Model-View-Controller)**
   - Implement a clear separation of concerns using the MVC pattern
   - **Models**: Define data structures and business logic
   - **Views**: Handle presentation layer and user interface
   - **Controllers**: Manage application flow and coordinate between models and views
   - Organize code in separate modules/files for better readability and maintainability

2. **ORM Implementation**
   - Use SQLAlchemy (or equivalent ORM) for all database operations
   - **DO NOT** write raw SQL queries
   - Define database models using ORM classes
   - Use ORM query methods for all CRUD operations
   - Implement proper relationships between models (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)
   - Use database migrations if applicable

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement specific and meaningful error handling throughout the application
   - **AVOID** generic error messages like "Error in user generation" or "An error occurred"
   - Use custom exception classes for different error types
   - Provide detailed, contextual error messages that include:
     - What operation failed
     - Why it failed (specific cause)
     - Relevant context (e.g., user_id, course_id, etc.)
   - Example of good error handling:
```python
     # BAD
     except Exception as e:
         print("Error in user generation")
     
     # GOOD
     except DatabaseConnectionError as e:
         logger.error(f"Failed to connect to database at {db_url}: {str(e)}")
     except UserValidationError as e:
         logger.error(f"Invalid user data for user_id {user_id}: {e.validation_errors}")
```
   - Implement proper logging with different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - Use try-except blocks strategically, not as catch-all wrappers

**Code Quality:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines (for Python)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility principle)
- Implement dependency injection where appropriate
- Use type hints for better code clarity
