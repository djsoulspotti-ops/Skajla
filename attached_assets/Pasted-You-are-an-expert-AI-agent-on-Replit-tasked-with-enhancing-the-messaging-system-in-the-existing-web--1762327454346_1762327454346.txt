You are an expert AI agent on Replit tasked with enhancing the messaging system in the existing web app designed for M&A professionals. This app already includes core features like deal tracking, due diligence tools, and collaboration, and now you need to add a dynamic visual element to the messaging button to indicate online users.

Your mission is to implement a feature where, around the messaging system button (e.g., a chat icon or button that opens the messaging interface), the profile icons (avatars) of users who are currently online circulate in a circular motion. This animation should be smooth, engaging, and non-intrusive, providing a real-time visual cue of active collaborators without overwhelming the UI.

Follow these steps precisely and iteratively to create and integrate this feature:

1. **Review the Existing Messaging Button**: Locate the messaging button in the current codebase (likely in the main navigation, sidebar, or header). Identify its HTML/CSS structure (e.g., a <button> or <div> with an icon like a speech bubble). Note any existing event handlers for opening the chat interface. If the app uses a framework like React, Vue, or plain JavaScript, adapt accordingly.

2. **Set Up Online User Detection**:
   - Implement or integrate a mechanism to detect and track online users. Use WebSockets (e.g., via Socket.io if not already set up) or a real-time database like Firebase/Realtime Database to maintain a list of active users.
   - Store online users in a state or array, including their user IDs, names, and avatar URLs (e.g., profile pictures). Simulate this with dummy data initially if real-time backend isn't fully implemented, but ensure it's extensible to real users in an M&A team context.
   - Update the online user list dynamically (e.g., every few seconds or on events like user login/logout).

3. **Design the Circular Animation**:
   - Create a container around the messaging button (e.g., a relative-positioned <div>).
   - Dynamically generate small avatar icons (e.g., circular <img> elements, 20-30px in size) for each online user.
   - Position these avatars in a circular orbit around the button using CSS animations or JavaScript (e.g., via requestAnimationFrame for smooth movement).
   - Animation details:
     - Avatars should rotate in a clockwise or counterclockwise circle (radius: 40-60px, adjustable based on button size).
     - Speed: Slow and steady (e.g., full rotation in 10-20 seconds) to avoid distraction.
     - Overlap handling: If many users (e.g., >5), limit to top 5-7 avatars or stack/group them intelligently.
     - Hover/Interaction: On hover over the button, pause the animation and tooltip user names; on click, open the messaging interface as before.
     - Responsiveness: Ensure it works on mobile/desktop; hide or simplify on small screens if needed.
   - Use CSS for animation where possible (e.g., @keyframes for rotation) for performance, falling back to JS for dynamic positioning.

4. **Technical Implementation**:
   - If using plain HTML/CSS/JS: Add styles for .online-avatars class with transform: rotate() and animation properties.
   - If React/Vue: Create a component (e.g., OnlineUsersOrbit) that renders avatars based on state and uses useEffect for animation loops.
   - Handle edge cases: No online users (hide animation), user joins/leaves (smooth add/remove with transitions), performance optimization (throttle updates).
   - Integrate with existing auth system to fetch real avatars (e.g., from a user database or placeholders like Gravatar).

5. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Test the animation in various browsers and devices for smoothness (aim for 60fps).
   - Simulate multiple online users and verify real-time updates.
   - Ensure it doesn't interfere with M&A workflows (e.g., doesn't block button clicks).
   - Iterate at least once: Gather simulated feedback (e.g., "too fast" or "cluttered") and refine.

6. **Deployment and Documentation**:
   - Commit changes incrementally on Replit.
   - Update the README with details on this feature, including how it indicates online presence for collaborative M&A tasks.
   - Ensure the app remains deployable and performant.
