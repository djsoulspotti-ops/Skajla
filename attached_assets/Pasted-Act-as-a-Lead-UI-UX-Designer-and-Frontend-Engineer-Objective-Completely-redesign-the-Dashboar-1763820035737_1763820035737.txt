Act as a Lead UI/UX Designer and Frontend Engineer.

**Objective:**
Completely redesign the Dashboard interfaces for the three core roles: **Student, Teacher, and Principal**.
The goal is to achieve an "Excellent" user experience that is visually stunning, professional, and highly space-efficient.

**Core Design Philosophy:**
"Clean, Strategic, and Clutter-Free."
Avoid filling the screen with huge buttons. Instead, use a structured layout where services and icons are positioned strategically based on frequency of use.

Please execute the redesign following these guidelines:

**1. Layout & Navigation (Space Efficiency):**
* **Implement a Collapsible Sidebar or Compact Navbar:** Move the main navigation (Home, Register, Chat, Calendar) to the side or top to maximize the central workspace.
* **"Bento Grid" Concept:** Display the main services (like "Latest Grades," "Next Lesson," "Messages") as compact, organized cards in a grid system. This prevents the "wall of text" effect.

**2. Role-Specific Optimization (Strategic Placement):**
* **Student Dashboard:**
    * **Focus:** Immediate visibility of the "Next Lesson," "Gamification Level," and "Recent Grades."
    * **Placement:** Put the schedule and current status at the top (Hero area). Keep less used services in a "Tools" dropdown.
* **Teacher Dashboard:**
    * **Focus:** Efficiency. Quick access to "Take Attendance" and "Input Grades."
    * **Placement:** Create "Quick Action" buttons for the current active class. Don't force them to click 3 times to find the register.
* **Principal Dashboard:**
    * **Focus:** Overview. High-level statistics (School Attendance %, Active Users).
    * **Placement:** An Analytics summary at the top, with administrative tools grouped below.

**3. Visual Style:**
* Use modern, high-quality icons (e.g., Lucide, Heroicons, or FontAwesome).
* Use whitespace effectively to separate sections without using heavy borders.
* Ensure the design is fully responsive (Mobile-friendly).

**Constraint:**
Do not remove functionality, only reorganize and restyle. The final result must look like a premium SaaS application, not a basic website.

Start by describing the layout structure you plan to apply (e.g., Sidebar vs Topbar) before writing the code.
